# retry

`retry` is a middleware which works with x/events. it will retry with exponential back-off algorism until max retry count which is passed by argument for middleware.

## Installation

```go
go get -u github.com/blacklane/go-libs/retry
```

## Getting Started: WIP

```go
hb := xevents.HandlerBuilder{}
hb.AddHandler(handler)
hb.UseMiddleware(
		retry.Middleware(maxRetry),
	)
```

in handler, if it return RetriableError then will be retried.

```go

```
